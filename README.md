## Perform Sentiment Analysis

This section of the notebook focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the collected YouTube comments. It uses natural language processing techniques to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Word Cloud Analysis

In this section, word clouds are generated to visualize the most frequently used words in the YouTube comments. This provides a quick and intuitive way to see what users are talking about the most.

### Conclusion

From the word cloud analysis, we observe that positive users are emphasizing words like "best," "awesome," "perfect," "amazing," "look," "happy," etc.

## Emoji Analysis

This section involves analyzing the emojis used in the YouTube comments. By computing the frequencies of each emoji, we can gain further insights into the emotions and sentiments expressed by users.

### Now we have to compute frequencies of each & every emoji in "all_emojis_list"..

## Conclusions

The final section of the notebook summarizes the key findings from the sentiment analysis, word cloud analysis, and emoji analysis. These insights can be valuable for understanding user sentiment and improving content strategy.
